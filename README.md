# Aaaargh! the game
This is an old university project. Task was to make some cleint/server app that uses ADO.NET, so i made this game.
It is 2D medieval themed multiplayer slasher game.

### Performance
I wasn't familiar with OpenGL back then, so this game is rendered entirely by CPU. On Windows XP it performed quite good, but on Windows 7 and newer performance is bloody terrible (don't know why, they changed something in window drawing in Win7). Also netcode is a total mess and the game was only tested on LAN.

## Disclaimer
Some assets are not made by me (because i draw like a retard), i found them on the internet. Consider them programmer art. I do not know who are the real authors and i'm not sure if they are free or not, but i do not monetize my app, so i consider this a fair use.
